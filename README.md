Mazamas Calendar Scraper
=======

I love Mazamas, but their web site leaves a fair bit to be 
desired. (It looks like the site was built by the folks at [OMBU](https://ombu.dev/work/mazamas)
and uses a free  version of the Salesforce database for their backend.)
Among other issues, their calendar is super slow to load and the
search functionality is not the most user friendly.  Thankfully they
do provide a direct link to download the calendar as a csv so this
is script is my workaround until they fix their web site.
